      It's great to relax and enjoy a haircut for once knowing that you are in
      the skilled care of a Master Barber. I've never had a better haircut.
      Sandra makes me look 10 years younger and feel twice as smart which is
      some achievement!

      The best barbers in Kilkenny. Lovely friendly staff who always give you
      exactly what you want. I wouldn’t go anywhere else. Can’t recommend
      enough. 10/10.

      I took my son for his haircut today which is usually stressful on him but
      the owner was so friendly and professional and put him right at ease.
      Great service at a great price. Will definitely be back.
